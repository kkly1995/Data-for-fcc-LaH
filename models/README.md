The two models, trained on the two datasets provided, are given here, along with their input scripts. Training and simulation were performed with `deepmd-kit 1.3.4.` All simulation results in our paper were produced using the model in `subtracted`. The models are presented as `graph.pb` in each directory, produced via `dp freeze -o graph.pb` after training. The `input.json` scripts are modified slightly from their original form, only in the `"systems"` field, to try and match the structure of this repository. For an example on how to use the subtracted model, see the `tables` directory.
